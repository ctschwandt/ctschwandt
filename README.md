## Hi, I’m Cole 👋

I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics undergraduate who enjoys building low-level software. Most of my work lives close to the metal: C/C++, OpenGL, assembly, and performance-oriented systems code.

### 🧩 Things I’ve built

#### 🖥️ MIPS Assembly Interpreter (C++)
A full MIPS32 interpreter built from scratch.
- Custom lexer + parser
- Simulated register file and memory model
- Branching, labels, arithmetic, and control flow
- Interactive REPL for stepping through programs

#### 🎮 OpenGL Maze FPS (C++, OpenGL)
A first-person shooter inside a procedurally generated maze.
- First-person + top-down camera modes
- Enemy AI, projectiles, and collision detection
- Visibility-based rendering for performance
- Textured environments and dynamic gameplay

#### ⚙️ Quadtree Collision Simulator (C++, SDL)
A performance-focused 2D particle simulation.
- 1000 elastic particle collisions
- Brute-force vs quadtree collision detection
- FPS benchmarking and algorithm comparison
- Optional vector-field “whirlpool” effect

#### 🌐 Talbook (Python, Flask, MySQL)
A Facebook/Marketplace-style web app for music gear.
- User accounts, posts, listings, and messaging
- Designed relational schema with a teammate
- Backend-heavy focus on data modeling and routing
