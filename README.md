## Hi, I’m Cole 👋

I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics undergraduate who enjoys building software **from the ground up** — interpreters, graphics engines, simulations, and tools where I can see how things really work.

Most of my work lives close to the metal: C++, OpenGL, assembly, and performance-oriented systems code.

---

### 🧠 What I’m interested in
- Systems programming & computer architecture  
- Graphics programming (OpenGL, real-time rendering)  
- Algorithms, data structures, and performance analysis  
- Simulations, interpreters, and low-level tooling  

---

### 🧩 Things I’ve built

#### 🖥️ MIPS Assembly Interpreter (C++)
A full MIPS32 interpreter built from scratch.
- Custom lexer + parser
- Simulated register file and memory model
- Branching, labels, arithmetic, and control flow
- Interactive REPL for stepping through programs

#### 🎮 OpenGL Maze FPS (C++, OpenGL)
A first-person shooter inside a procedurally generated maze.
- First-person + top-down camera modes
- Enemy AI, projectiles, and collision detection
- Visibility-based rendering for performance
- Textured environments and dynamic gameplay

#### ⚙️ Quadtree Collision Simulator (C++, SDL)
A performance-focused 2D particle simulation.
- 1000 elastic particle collisions
- Brute-force vs quadtree collision detection
- FPS benchmarking and algorithm comparison
- Optional vector-field “whirlpool” effect

#### 🌐 Talbook (Python, Flask, MySQL)
A Facebook/Marketplace-style web app for music gear.
- User accounts, posts, listings, and messaging
- Designed relational schema with a teammate
- Backend-heavy focus on data modeling and routing

> You’ll also find smaller projects here: procedural terrain generation, fractal renderers, database systems, cryptanalysis scripts, and assembly-level programs.

### 🧪 Research
**NSF REU — Missouri University of Science & Technology (Summer 2025)**  
Worked on AI-assisted path planning under dynamic energy constraints.  
Built experimental tooling, ran simulations, and presented results to faculty.

---

### 🛠️ Tools I use
- **Languages:** C++, Python, SQL, MIPS Assembly  
- **Graphics:** OpenGL, FreeGLUT, SDL  
- **Backend / ML:** Flask, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3  
- **Tooling:** Linux, Git, Make, GDB, AddressSanitizer, Bash  

---

### 📌 Currently
- Refining my OpenGL engine projects
- Writing cleaner, more modular systems code
- Preparing for systems / graphics / low-level software internships
